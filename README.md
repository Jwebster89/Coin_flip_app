# Coin_flip_app
A coin flipping app for use with Magic The Gathering

This has two options, flip a coin which flips one coin and returns "success" or "fail", and a second option that flips a coin until it results in a fail; returning the number of successful flips in a row.

A third button toggles "Krark's thumb" on and off, adding a second coin flip to the two flipping options and returning a "success" if either coin flips a success.
