# Coin Flipper App

This app allows the user to flip a coin (or two coins if Krark's thumb is on). The user can also flip coins until failure, and the number of successes will be displayed.

## How to Use

1. Run the app by calling `python main.py`.
2. Click the "Flip Coin" button to flip a single coin (or two if Krark's thumb is on). The result will be displayed below the buttons.
3. Click the "Flip Until Fail" button to flip coins until failure. The number of successes will be displayed below the buttons.
4. Click the "Krark's Thumb" toggle button to enable Krark's thumb, which causes two coins to be flipped instead of one.
